# Traffic-Sign-Classification-using-CNN
This project presents an effective solution to detect traffic signs on road by first classifying the traffic sign images using Convolutional Neural Network on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark and then detecting the images of Indian Traffic Signs using the Indian Dataset which will be used as testing dataset while building classification model.
